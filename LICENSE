Studio Marketplace Package License

Copyright (c) 2025 Kawika Ohumukini. All rights reserved.

This license governs the use of provider packages, service definitions,
and templates ("Packages") distributed through the Studio Marketplace.
Packages are add-ons that extend the Studio platform. The Studio platform
itself is licensed separately under the Studio Use License.


1. PERMITTED USE

You may:

  (a) Install and use Packages on your own Studio deployment.

  (b) Modify Packages for your own use on your own deployment.

  (c) Use Packages to deliver services to your customers through your
      Studio deployment.

  (d) Create, sell, and distribute workflow configurations, templates,
      and automations that reference Packages. These are your
      intellectual property.

  (e) Sell any output produced using Packages (images, video, text,
      data, or any other generated content).

  (f) Contribute improvements back to this project.


2. RESTRICTIONS

You may not:

  (a) Redistribute, sideload, bundle, or transfer Packages to any
      Studio deployment other than your own. Each deploying party must
      obtain Packages directly from the official Studio Marketplace.

  (b) Publish Packages or derivative works to competing marketplaces,
      package registries, or distribution channels.

  (c) Sublicense or sell Packages as standalone products or components.

  (d) Remove or alter any copyright, trademark, or license notices
      included in the Packages.

  (e) You may not use Marketplace Packages to offer a hosted service 
      whose primary purpose is to provide Studio or Studio-equivalent 
      functionality to third parties.

For clarity: sharing a workflow configuration that references a Package
is permitted. Sharing the Package itself is not. A recipient of a shared
workflow must obtain required Packages independently from the official
Studio Marketplace.


3. ACCESS TIERS

  (a) Basic tier Packages are freely available through the public
      catalog (studio-catalog).

  (b) Advanced tier Packages require a valid marketplace membership
      and are distributed through the token-gated repository
      (studio-marketplace).

  (c) Marketplace access and Package entitlements are non-transferable
      between deploying parties.


4. TRADEMARKS

"Studio," "Self-Host Studio," "Self-Host Hub," and associated logos and
marks are trademarks of the copyright holder. Nothing in this license
grants the right to use these names or marks as part of a product name,
company name, or primary branding.
